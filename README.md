# Respondent Technical Challenge

This is the response to the take-home challenge. Was given both FE and BE challenges, decided to do the BE challenge, but put the sorting algorithm behind a small REST API and included a simple web client for viewing results. You can run both, or simply the API and use an HTTP client of your choosing.
